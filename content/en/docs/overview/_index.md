Before your company can publish Product offerings in the DOME Marketplace, the following steps have to be performed, collectively called Onboarding:

1. **Company registration** in the DOME Marketplace

    1. The employee performing the onboarding process has to be able to demonstrate to the DOME Operator that it has the powers required to act on behalf of your company for the process of onboarding in DOME. The employee can be a legal representative or an employee "nominated" by a legal representative for the specific purpose of performing the process of onboarding in DOME. 
    2. You have to demonstrate that your company is incorporated and that is has basic legal capacity to act in the EU internal market.

2. **Service Certification**, required to be able to create and publish a product offering in the marketplace. It is done for each product offering.
    1. For each product offering that you want to publish in the DOME Marketplace, your company has to demonstrate that the service complies with the requirements setup by DOME (as per the requirements from the European Commission and Member States).
